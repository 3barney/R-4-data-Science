# Assing mpg data to our data variable
fuel_economy_data <- mpg

# 1. Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
ggplot(data = fuel_economy_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))

## Its trying to set the color aesthetic manually, hence it should go outside of the aes function,
## color being aesthetic should map to a variable


# 2. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous?
?mpg

## Categorical -> manufacturer, model, cyl, trans, drv, fl, class
## Continous   -> displ, year, cty, hwy,


# 3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape.
#    How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?
ggplot(data = fuel_economy_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color=year))

ggplot(data = fuel_economy_data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size=yeat))
